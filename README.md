# translator-inator V 0.1.2
Now with less ghosts!
## About
Just a simple Python program to translate input text through the GoogleTrans module as many times as you want, often generating gibberish.

Do you think this tool makes the creator of the GoogleTrans module lay awake at night, questioning everything? Or maybe just pisses them off because I keep sending calls to their tool over and over and over with the express purpose of generating nothingness? The world may never know.
## Use
### Ensure you have the googletrans module installed
    Assuming you have Python installed and properly configured, Run the following pip commands to ensure you have the proper modules installed:
    for googletrans:

    ```
    pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
    ```
    for prompter:
    ```
    pip install prompter
    ```

### Dowload and run the file, following the promps to input text and number of itterations
